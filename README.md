# Project Title: NLP Movie Recommendation Model

Briefly describe the purpose/result(s) of your project, the skills you applied, and the AI4ALL Ignite program.

Purpose: To make searching for movies more efficient by prompting the user for a few important variables to help make the top 3 recommendations for their preferences.


## Problem Statement <!--- do not change this line -->

The Solution for our problem is that people can save time from the hassle of searching on platforms like Netflix and instead can identify what movie fits best for their preferences and to ensure a seamless experience for our users.

## Key Results <!--- do not change this line -->


*EXAMPLE:*
1. *Recorded over 1,000 unique prompts and their responses generated by ChatGPT*
2. *Identified three biases in ChatGPT's responses*
   - *When prompted about this world event*
   - *When prompted about this field of science*
   - *When prompted about this political party*
  
1. *Taking a database of the top 5,000 global movies and sorting through 48 genre clusters to deliver the most optimal recommendation*


## Methodologies <!--- do not change this line -->

(UPDATE IN README.md)

*EXAMPLE:*
*To accomplish this, we utilized the OpenAI API to interact with ChatGPT, and we designed a custom Python script to generate diverse prompts and collect corresponding responses. The data was then processed and analyzed using pandas, enabling us to detect patterns and biases in the AI model's outputs.*
*Engineered a Python script to generate over 1,000 prompts and elicit their responses from ChatGPT, utilizing pandas to collect the data. When prompted for solutions to this specific relevant crisis, nearly 80% of ChatGPT's responses promoted a certain worldview.*

1. *We used Sentiment Analysis through user text as to what movie they would prefer to watch or what they would like to see in a movie (vaderSentiment) as well as Genre and the Start and End Year variables which can by consciously letting the user pick from a range of either newer movies, older movies, or can select the entire range for the highest overall recommendation score.*
